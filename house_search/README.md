# House Attributes

This script uses the Google Maps API to retrieve a location's altitude, plus the travel times from that location to a list of other locations. It's meant to save me a few clicks when I see an interesting property for sale.

## Example

`house_attributes.py "1234 My Road, Pleasantville, CO"`
